# JS-Atomic 02: Output

For this atomic, you'll be using `alert()` and `console.log()` to display some pre-determined output.

First, you'll need an **index.html**, which I've started for you below. You'll also need a Javascript file and for the **index.html** file to include it. (The Javascript file is not provided. That is for you to make yourself.)

Here are the tasks:

1. Create an `alert()` that greets the visitor and tells them your name (pick either your real name or some fictional character whom you'd like to impersonate for the duration of this exercise).
2. Use `console.log()` to output (one `console.log()` statement per line):
  + Your favorite breakfast
  + How many cats live with you
  + Your favorite place to eat lots of food
  + The number of naps you take per week.
  + The number of naps you'd like to take per week
  + (Or you can make up your own questions -- just make sure there are 4 or 5 of 'em)
3. Another `alert()` that says "Goodbye" to the user.

Your program should perform these tasks in this order. Make sure to organize your code so that there are line-breaks separating the different sections, and use comments (lines beginning with `//`) to leave notes for yourself. Make sure that each line of code ends with a semicolon and that you're being consistent with your whitespace usage.

If you get stuck, try googling a bit and check your notes, then consider checking the *Solution* folder, which has a complete working version of this program (minus the answers to the questions below). If you checked the solutions folder to get yourself unstuck, make sure that you write down in your notes what you were trying to do, what you were doing incorrectly, and what you had to change to make it correct.

Once you're done with these tasks, in your *index.html* file's `<body>`, answer the following questions (with a sentence or two each). Your page should have an `<h1>`-level header that functions as the title. Each of the questions should be an `<h2>`-level header, with the answers to each wrapped in paragraph tags.
  
1. What's the difference between `alert()` and `console.log()`?
2. What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?
3. What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?
4. Would it make sense to use `console.log()` to tell the user things? Why or why not?
5. What's one way that `console.log()` might be a good tool for you to use?
6. When do the `console.log()` statements get run? Is it before the first `alert()` gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?
7. What questions do you have?
