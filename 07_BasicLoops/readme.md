# JS Atomics 07 - Loops

Complete these atomics just like you did the last section. Make sure to thoughtfully organize your Git repository.

## 7A: While Loops

Use a while loop to count from 1-10 (do your output either using `console.log()` or `alert()`).

## 7B: More Counting

Prompt the user for a start value and an end value. Count from the start value to the end value using a `while` loop. Make sure to account for the start-value being equal to or greater than the end-value (should it not count? Should it count down instead of up in such cases?).

Extend this by asking the user what increment they want to count by.

## 7C: A Fizzy Drink

Implement the *99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall* song using a loop. Make sure to account for having 1 bottle (instead of "1 bottles"). Use a `while` loop.

## 7D: More Fizz

Implement [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). This program counts numbers as normal, except that when the number is divisible by 3, you output "Fizz", when it's divisible by 5, you output "Buzz", and when it's divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g. 15, 30, etc.), output "FizzBuzz". Thus, you should have something that looks like this:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
12
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

Extend this by prompting the user for a start value and an end value. Use a `while` loop.

## 7E-H: What For?

Re-do the previous 4 exercises, but with a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop. Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each? Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?
