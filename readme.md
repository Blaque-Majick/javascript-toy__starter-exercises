# Javascript - Atomic Exercises

We use Javascript to determine dynamic behavior for our sites and to manipulate the DOM. Javascript is a fully-featured programming language; our focuses are domain-specific, but you can use Javascript to do almost anything any other programming language can do.

For all of these atomic assessments, you'll be provided (at least some) HTML, a concrete task, and often a Javascript starter.

In terms of best ways to practice, the more practice you can get, the better. There are quite a few atomics here, and for many of them, I've included some ideas for extension exercises.

Each of the atomics is already in its own folder. For each exercise, you will need to create and/or modify some files in that folder. In the end, each set of atomics can act as a reference for you later.

Solutions are provided for some of the first batch of exercises.

To begin, check the README for the first atomic exercise.
