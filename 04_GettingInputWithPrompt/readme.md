# JS Atomic 04 - Input with Prompt

## Description

This exercise is our first time getting information from the user and then using it in a program. You'll again need an HTML file and a Javascript file. (Follow the pattern that already exists.)

## Tasks

Write Javascript that accomplishes the following tasks, in order:

1. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their name, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
2. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their age, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
3. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their hometown, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
4. Ask the user (using `prompt()`) for their favorite number, then assign that value to a well-named variable.
5. Output each of those values using both `console.log()` and `alert()`. You can output the value itself with no context around it, but it's a better decision to use each of those values in a sentence. For example: "Your name is Aloysius."

## Questions

Once you're done with the Javascript tasks, answer these questions in the body of your HTML file (formatted however makes the most sense -- maybe similar to how you've been doing it for previous atomics):

1. What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use `typeof` and `console.log()` to help with this.
2. What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?
3. How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?
4. If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?
5. In these exercises, we use `prompt()` to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use `prompt()` -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with `prompt()`? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use `prompt()`?
6. Research `prompt()` -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
7. What questions do you have?
