  <h2>
    What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as <code>NaN</code>?
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Expected:</strong> I believe that the <code>NaN</code> value will void any mathematical functions trying to be done on it and cause all of the conditiontals to evaluate as <code>false</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Observed:</strong> My initial prediction was correct. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Expected:</strong> I'm assuming that if one of the numbers equals 0 the conditional statments will still evaluate as <code>true</code> and it will consider the triangle valid. I believe this will also occur if all three lengths are zero, however, in the event that only 2 lengths are zero I postulate that it will return that the triangle is invalid. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Observed:</strong> I was incorrect. Each of the zero situations produced an invalid triangle since there was always at least one conditional that failed.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Expected:</strong>I believe that the math will successfully evaluate, however, I don't think there will be any time when the triangle will be deemed valid since there will always be at least one <code>false</code> statment.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Observed:</strong>My assumption was correct.
